# Rule-based-chatbot
# What I built?

I built a simple rule-based chatbot using Flask, a Python web framework. The chatbot can understand basic user inputs and respond accordingly. It can answer questions, tell jokes, display the current time, and provide basic assistance.

# How it works?

The chatbot works as follows:

1. User input: The user types a message in the input field and submits it.
2. Processing: The chatbot processes the user input using a rule-based system, which matches the input to predefined responses.
3. Response: The chatbot generates a response based on the matched rule and displays it to the user.
4. Conversation history: The chatbot stores the conversation history, allowing users to see previous interactions.
